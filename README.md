## Initial Setup
_First steps:_  
1. Create a repository on github
2. Then in any porgram on the command line type in `git init`
3. Afterwards, type in `git config`
4. It will show you a lists of commands in which you will type in `user.name(email) --global [insert name or email]`
5. Once that is complete you must confirm that the program you are using is connected to the repository on github to `push` your changes back into the repository.
